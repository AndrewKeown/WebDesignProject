                    A long-gestating movie about the life of Michael Jackson is set to start production this year
                    The film, called Michael, will be directed by Antoine Fuqua, whose credits include Training Day, The Equalizer and, most recently, slavery thriller Emancipation. 
                    The screenplay will come from three-time Oscar nominee John Logan, who wrote the scripts for Gladiator and Skyfall.
                    Michael will also be made in conjunction with the singer’s estate with co-executors John Branca and John McClain producing alongside Graham King, who has previously been involved with bringing Bohemian Rhapsody to the screen.

                    The film is being made with the cooperation of the Michael Jackson estate, which may influence the way “Michael” depicts the multiple allegations of child sexual abuse that were brought against Jackson during his career and following his death. 
                    Jackson has denied allegations of child sexual abuse and he was tried, and found not guilty, of child molestation in 2003. 
                    Jackson died in 2009 at the age of 50 and always maintained his innocence, but his estate condemned it as
                    “tabloid character assassination”

                    “Michael” will be the first major film role for Jaafar Jackson, the second-youngest son to songwriter, producer and Jackson 5 member Jermaine Jackson, whose brother was Michael Jackson.


                    The singer’s mother Katherine Jackson said “Jaafar embodies my son. It’s so wonderful to see him carry on the Jackson legacy of entertainers and performers,” 


                    Producer Graham King, whose credits include “Bohemian Rhapsody,” says the team administered a worldwide casting search before finding the actor who would portray Jackson. It was a Jackson all along.

                    Producer Graham King, whose credits include “Bohemian Rhapsody,” says the team administered a worldwide casting search before finding the actor who would portray Jackson.


                    “I met Jaafar over two years ago and was blown away by the way he organically personifies the spirit and personality of Michael,” said King. 

                    “It was something so powerful that even after conducting a worldwide search, it was clear that he is the only person to take on this role. 
                    
                    I am beyond thrilled that he has come on board to portray his uncle and cannot wait for the world to see him on the big screen as Michael Jackson.”
