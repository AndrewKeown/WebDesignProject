                        The eight child of the Jackson family. A talented, outgoing child, he dazzled in the spotlight as part of the Jackson 5. By the early 1970s, Jackson was a fresh-faced teen fronting a Motown-signed family musical group who had their own television series, 
                        a Saturday morning cartoon and recorded hits such as<br>
                        “I Want You Back”<br> 
                        “I'll Be There.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.ducksters.com/biography/entertainers/michael_jackson.php#:~:text=Michael%20grew%20up%20in%20a,two%20bedrooms%20for%20eleven%20people.">more info...</a>

                        Jackson began his solo career in 1971 while at Mowtown Records.<br>
                        Michael made his first solo Record called “Off the Wall”.<br> 
                        With songs such as<br> 
                        “Don’t Stop’til You Get Enough”<br>
                        “Working day and night”<br><br>
                
                        Then from there it was the album Thriller.<br>
                        With songs such as<br> 
                        “Billie Jean”,<br>

                        Michael was working a pepsi commercial while suddenly, some pyrotechnics went off bigger than expected,<br> 
                        launching embers into Jackson’s hair and face,<br> 
                        leaving his head engulfed in flame.<br><br>

                        Jackson continued performing briefly, apparently not realising he was on fire,<br>
                        before his entourage jumped on him and put the fire out.<br><br>

                        Jackson’s doctor at the time, Steven Hoefflin, commented that the star was <br>
                        “noted to be quite shaken up with palm-sized area of second-degree and small area of third-degree burns”.<br>

                        On June 25, 2009, Michael Jackson died of cardiac arrest in Los Angeles, California, at age 50. Jackson's death, 
                        which was caused by a lethal combination of sedatives and propofol, an anesthetic, was ruled a homicide. 
                        In 2011 Conrad Murray, Jackson's personal doctor, was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter.
