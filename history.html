                        The eight child of the Jackson family. A talented, outgoing child, he dazzled in the spotlight as part of the Jackson 5. By the early 1970s, Jackson was a fresh-faced teen fronting a Motown-signed family musical group who had their own television series, 
                        a Saturday morning cartoon and recorded hits such as “I Want You Back” and “I'll Be There.”</p>

                        Jackson began his solo career in 1971 while at Mowtown Records.
                        Michael made his first solo Record called “Off the Wall”. 
                        With songs such as 
                        Don’t Stop ’til You Get Enough
                        Working day and night

                        Then from there it was the album Thriller.
                        With songs such as 
                        Billie Jean,
                        Beat It.

                        Then the album Bad
                        With songs such as 
                        Bad,
                        “Just Good Friends”.


                        Followed by the album called Dangerous
                        With songs such as 
                        Dangerous,
                        Remember the Time.

                        Michael was working a pepsi commercial while suddenly, some pyrotechnics went off bigger than expected, 
                        launching embers into Jackson’s hair and face, 
                        leaving his head engulfed in flame.

                        Jackson continued performing briefly, apparently not realising he was on fire,
                        before his entourage jumped on him and put the fire out.

                        Jackson’s doctor at the time, Steven Hoefflin, commented that the star was 
                        “noted to be quite shaken up with palm-sized area of second-degree and small area of third-degree burns”.

                        On June 25, 2009, Michael Jackson died of cardiac arrest in Los Angeles, California, at age 50. Jackson's death, 
                        which was caused by a lethal combination of sedatives and propofol, an anesthetic, was ruled a homicide. 
                        In 2011 Conrad Murray, Jackson's personal doctor, was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter.
